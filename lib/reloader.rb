module Framework
# == The Camping Reloader
#
# Camping apps are generally small and predictable.  Many Camping apps are
# contained within a single file.  Larger apps are split into a handful of
# other Ruby libraries within the same directory.
#
# Since Camping apps (and their dependencies) are loaded with Ruby's require
# method, there is a record of them in $LOADED_FEATURES.  Which leaves a
# perfect space for this class to manage auto-reloading an app if any of its
# immediate dependencies changes.
#
# == Wrapping Your Apps
#
# Since bin/camping and the Camping::FastCGI class already use the Reloader,
# you probably don't need to hack it on your own.  But, if you're rolling your
# own situation, here's how.
#
# Rather than this:
#
#   require 'yourapp'
#
# Use this:
#
#   require 'camping/reloader'
#   Camping::Reloader.new('/path/to/yourapp.rb')
#
# The reloader will take care of requiring the app and monitoring all files
# for alterations.
class Reloader
    attr_accessor :klass, :mtime, :mount, :requires

    # Creates the reloader, assigns a +script+ to it and initially loads the
    # application.  Pass in the full path to the script, otherwise the script
    # will be loaded relative to the current working directory.
    def initialize(script)
        @script = File.expand_path(script)
        @mount = File.basename(script, '.rb')
        @requires = nil

    def find_app(title)
        @klass = Object.const_get(Object.constants.grep(/^#{title}$/i)[0]) rescue nil
    end

    # If the file isn't found, if we need to remove the app from the global
    # namespace, this will be sure to do so and set @klass to nil.
