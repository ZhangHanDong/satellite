* (5) better installation instructions
* (4) list page: icons to rename, delete pages/uploads
* (4) allow deletion of uploads
* (3) fork ruby/git instead of monkeypatching it

* (2) allow renaming of uploads
* (2) list page: highlight orphaned (no incoming links) items with red backgrounds

* revert page to some previous version

=== Later?

* multiple remote repository support (instead of master/slave)
* tagging
* del.icio.us integration
* switch from direct mongrel inheritance to rack adapter
* take another look at app auto-reloading
